# IIR-Filter-Realization
  IIR filters are also called recursive filters because of the feedback from the output. Unlike the FIR filters, their stability is not guaranteed throughout the range and show linear response for a particular band of frequencies.  Pole_zero_IIR_lattice_coeff.m - Computes the lattice coefficients (beta) when the transfer function of an IIR filter comprising poles and zeros is the input.  All_pole_IIR_lattice_coeff.m - Computes the lattice coefficients (A,B) when the transfer function of an IIR filter comprising poles is the input.
